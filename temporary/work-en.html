<p>New measures have been introduced for foreign workers in Canada and Canadian employers who are hiring them.</p>


</div><p>There  are two kinds of foreign workers in Canada – those who need a Labour  Market Impact Assessment (LMIA), and those who are LMIA-exempt. </p>
          <p>An  LMIA shows whether Canadians are available, or if there is a need for a foreign  worker. There are however, situations where foreign workers do not need an  LMIA. This may be the result of free-trade agreements such as NAFTA or youth  exchanges programs, for example, where there are reciprocal agreements that  benefit Canada.</p>
          <p>As a result of the  Temporary Foreign Worker Program review, a number of changes  have been introduced for foreign workers in Canada and the Canadian employers  who are hiring them.</p>
          <p> Among the changes, LMIA-exempt foreign workers  will now be part of the newly named International Mobility Program. This will distinguish them  from foreign workers who need a LMIA to enter Canada through the Temporary  Foreign Worker Program.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s  an overview of other changes coming, that will ensure both programs continue to  benefit Canadians: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Making employers of LMIA-exempt foreign  nationals (with employer-specific work permits) more accountable by requiring  them to submit their job offer to Citizenship and Immigration;</li>
            <li>Implementing a robust employer monitoring  system that will see thousands of employers of LMIA-exempt foreign nationals  inspected each year;</li>
            <li>Introducing new fees for LMIA-exempt  employer-specific work permits and for most open work permit applicants; and</li>
            <li>Adjusting the rules for several specific exemptions,  such the LMIA  exemption for intra-company transferees with specialized knowledge, to ensure  they continue to operate as intended and in Canada&rsquo;s best interests.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>For more information about the changes, please  see <a href="http://news.gc.ca/web/article-en.do?nid=859859">our news  release</a> and backgrounders. </p>


        
			<p>If you  need a work permit to work temporarily in Canada, you must make sure you are  eligible for one. Whether you are eligible or not depends on a few things,  including where you plan to apply for your work permit.</p>
            
<details>
				  <summary>Apply from outside Canada</summary>
				  <p>Anyone  may apply for a work permit before they enter Canada. In some cases, you must apply  to a visa office outside Canada. This is usually true if you need a visa to  enter Canada or if you need to have a medical exam before you come here.</p>
				  

</details>
        <details>						
            <summary>Apply from inside Canada</summary>
            <p>You can  only apply for a work permit from inside Canada if you:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>are currently in Canada and have a valid study or work permit, or your spouse or parents have a study or work permit,</li>
              <li>have graduated from a program at a
              <ul>
                <li>Canadian university, </li>
                <li>community college, </li>
                <li>CÉGEP, </li>
                <li>publicly funded trade/technical school or</li>
                <li>other eligible school,</li>
              </ul>
              </li>
              <li>have a temporary resident permit that is valid for six months or more, <strong>or</strong></li>
              <li>are in Canada because you have already applied for permanent residence from inside Canada (you will have to pass certain stages in the main application process to be eligible for a work permit). </li>
            </ul>
            
        </details>
                
    <details>
    <summary>Apply as you enter Canada</summary>
    <p>You can ask  to be allowed to work in Canada as you enter Canada but only if:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>you do not need a visa, </li>
        <li>you already hold a valid medical certificate, if you need it for your job, and </li>
        <li>your employer does not need a labour market opinion (LMO) for your job (with some exceptions) or you already have an LMO. </li>
      </ul>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> If your job does need an LMO, you can apply for a  work permit as you enter Canada, as long as your employer has approval to hire  you through an LMO before you enter the country. (This does not apply to live-in  caregivers and <a href="http://www.hrsdc.gc.ca/eng/jobs/foreign_workers/agriculture/seasonal/index.shtml">seasonal  agricultural workers</a>.)</p>
    <p>No matter  where you apply, you must:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>prove to an officer that you will leave Canada when your work permit expires, </li>
        <li>show that you have enough money to take care of yourself and your family members during your stay in Canada and to return home,</li>
        <li>obey the law and have no record of criminal activity (we may ask you to give us a police clearance       certificate),</li>
        <li>not be a danger to Canada’s security, </li>
        <li>be in good health and have a medical exam, if needed, </li>
        <li>not plan to work for an employer on the list of ineligible employers,</li>
        <li>not have worked in Canada for one or more periods that total four years after April 1, 2011 (with some exceptions), and</li>
        <li>give  the officer any other documents they ask for to prove you can enter the country.</li>
    </ul>
</details>
        
      <h2>Applying for a new visitor visa (to re-enter Canada)</h2>
      <p>If you  are currently in Canada with a valid study or work permit, and you want to  leave and then come back to Canada, you may need a visa to re-enter  Canada as a visitor.  <br>
If you  do, you must apply for a new temporary resident (visitor) visa before you leave.  To do so, you must:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>be legally in Canada as <strong>a student or temporary foreign worker</strong> <strong>only</strong> with a Canadian home address, </li>
        <li>have valid temporary resident status, and your existing counterfoil has expired and/or was valid for only one entry, and </li>
        <li>need a new visitor visa to return to Canada in the near future. </li>
      </ul>
