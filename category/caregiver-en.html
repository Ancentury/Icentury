  <section><p>Live-in caregivers are individuals who are qualified to provide care for children, elderly persons or persons with disabilities in private homes without supervision. Live-in caregivers must live in the private home where they work in Canada.</p><p>You must meet certain requirements to be eligible for the Live&#8209;in Caregiver Program in Canada.</p>			
			<p>You will need:</p>			

				<details>				
					<summary id="letter">A positive Labour Market Opinion (<abbr>LMO</abbr>) from an employer in Canada</summary>
					<p>Before hiring you, your employer must:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>apply to Employment and Social Development Canada/Service Canada (<abbr>ESDC</abbr>/<abbr>SC</abbr>) to have his or her suggested job offer reviewed; and </li>
						<li>receive a positive Labour Market Opinion (<abbr>LMO</abbr>) from <abbr title="Employment and Social Development Canada">ESDC</abbr>/<abbr title="Service Canada">SC</abbr>.</li>
					</ul>					
					<p><abbr title="Employment and Social Development Canada">ESDC</abbr>/<abbr title="Service Canada">SC</abbr> will assess your employer&#8217;s job offer and the employment contract to be sure that it meets the requirements for wages and working conditions and the provincial labour and employment standards, and that there are not enough Canadians or permanent residents available to work as live-in caregivers in Canada. If <abbr title="Employment and Social Development Canada">ESDC</abbr>/<abbr title="Service Canada">SC</abbr> finds the job offer acceptable, they will issue a positive <abbr title="Labour Market Opinion">LMO</abbr> to your employer.</p>					
					<p><strong>You will need to submit a copy of this positive <abbr title="Labour Market Opinion">LMO</abbr> when you apply for a work permit.</strong></p>
				</details>
				<details>		 
					<summary id="contract">A written contract with your future employer, signed by you and the employer</summary>
					
					<p>You and your future employer are legally required to sign a written employment contract. You must submit the signed contract with your work permit application. This must be the same employment contract submitted to <abbr title="Employment and Social Development Canada">ESDC</abbr>/<abbr title="Service Canada">SC</abbr> by your employer, unless you provide an explanation of any changes (for example, a new start date).</p>
					
					<p>The written employment contract will ensure there is a fair working arrangement between you and your employer.</p>
					
					<p>The employment contract must demonstrate that the Live-in Caregiver Program requirements are met by including a description of:</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>mandatory employer-paid benefits, including:
							<ul>
								<li>transportation to Canada from your country of permanent residence or the country of habitual residence to the location of work in Canada</li>
								<li>medical insurance coverage provided from the date of your arrival until you are eligible for provincial health insurance</li>
								<li>workplace safety insurance coverage for the duration of the employment</li>
								<li>all recruitment fees, including any amount payable to a third-party recruiter or agents hired by the employer that would otherwise have been charged to you</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>job duties </li>
						<li>hours of work</li>
						<li>wages</li>
						<li>accommodation arrangements (including room and board) </li>
						<li>holiday and sick leave entitlements</li>
						<li>termination and resignation terms </li>
					</ul>
					
					<p>A contract template is available on the <a href="http://www.servicecanada.gc.ca/cgi-bin/search/eforms/index.cgi?app=prfl&frm=emp5498&ln=eng">Service Canada</a> website. Your contract does not have to look exactly like this, but it must contain all the information and clauses indicated as mandatory.</p>
					<p>The use of an alternative  contract format may delay the processing of the <abbr title="Labour Market Opinion">LMO</abbr> application as <abbr title="Employment and Social Development Canada">ESDC</abbr> and  Service Canada officers will need to determine if the contract complies with  <abbr title="Live-in Caregiver Program">LCP</abbr> requirements.</p>

							<p><strong>Note:</strong> the contract template is different for the province of Quebec and is available on the <a href="http://www.immigration-quebec.gouv.qc.ca/en/forms/search-title/employment-contract.html"><span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">minist&egrave;re de l&rsquo;Immigration et des Communaut&eacute;s culturelles</span> (Quebec Immigration) website</a>.</p>

				<details>
				<summary id="school">Successful completion of the equivalent of a Canadian secondary school education</summary>
				
				<p>You must have successfully completed the equivalent of Canadian high school
				education (secondary school). Because of the differences in school systems
				across Canada, it is not possible to give a precise number of years. In
				most provinces, it takes 12 years of schooling to obtain a Canadian high
				school diploma. The immigration officer assessing your application will
				let you know what is needed.</p>
				</details>
				<details>
				<summary id="training">At least six months&#8217; training or at least one year of full-time paid work experience as a caregiver or in a related field or occupation (including six months with one employer) in the past three years</summary>
				
				<p>To claim work experience, you need to have worked for one year, including at least six months of continuous employment for the same employer. This work experience must be in a field or occupation specific to what you will do as a live-in caregiver. This experience must have been acquired within the three years immediately before the day on which you make an application for a work permit as a caregiver.</p>
				
				<p>To claim training, it must have been full-time training in a classroom setting. Areas of study could be early childhood education, geriatric care, pediatric nursing or first aid.</p>
				</details>
				<details>
				<summary id="english">Good knowledge of English or French</summary>
				
				<p>You must be able to speak, read and understand either English or French so that you can function on your own in your employer&#8217;s home. For example, you must be able to call emergency services if they are needed, and to understand labels on medication. You will be unsupervised for most of the day and may have to communicate with someone outside the home. You can also read and understand your rights and obligations if you can function in English or French.</p>
				</details>
				<details>
				<summary id="permit">A work permit before you enter Canada</summary>
				
				<p>To participate in the Live-in Caregiver Program,  you must make an application for an initial live-in caregiver work permit at a  visa office outside Canada. </p>
				<p>If your application is successful, you will receive a letter of introduction from the Canadian visa office responsible for your area. You will need to present this letter to the Border Services Officer upon arrival in Canada in order to obtain your work permit.</p>
