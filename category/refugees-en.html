  <section><p>Every year, on June 20, World Refugee Day gives us the chance to   focus the world&rsquo;s attention on the millions of refugees in need of   protection.</p>
  <p>There are more than 15.4 million refugees in the world who face   uncertain futures with great courage, in unfamiliar environments, as   they go about trying to rebuild their lives.</p>
  <p>Many live in desperate conditions, often forgotten by the world at large.</p>
  <p>Canada continues to have one of the most generous immigration and   refugee systems in the world. Canada welcome 1 out of every 10 of all   resettled refugees globally, more than most any other industrialized   country in the world.</p>
  <p>Canadians can be proud of the Government of Canada&rsquo;s record   contributions and long standing tradition of providing protection to   those who need it most, and will continue to do so.</p>
  <h2>Canada&rsquo;s refugee programs includes:</h2>
<details>  
 <summary><strong>Resettlement from outside Canada</strong></summary>
 <p>CIC relies on the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (<abbr>UNHCR</abbr>), other referral organizations and private sponsorship groups to find and refer refugees to be resettled in Canada.</p>
 
  <p>People who can be resettled from outside Canada fall into two classes.</p>
            
			<h3>1) Convention Refugee Abroad Class </h3>
			<p>You may be in this class if you: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>are outside your home country; and </li>
				<li>cannot return there due to a well-founded fear of persecution based on:
					<ul>
						<li>race,</li>
						<li>religion, </li>
						<li>political opinion,</li>
						<li>nationality, or</li>
						<li>membership in a particular social group, such as women or people with a particular sexual orientation.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>You must also be:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>outside Canada, and want to come to Canada,</li>
				<li>referred by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (<abbr>UNHCR</abbr>) or another referral organization, or be sponsored by a private sponsorship group, and</li>
				<li>selected as a government-assisted or privately sponsored refugee, or have the funds needed to support yourself and any dependants after you arrive in Canada.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h3>2) Country of Asylum Class</h3>
			<p>You may be in this class if you:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>are outside your home country or the country where you normally live and have been, and continue to be, seriously and personally affected by civil war or armed conflict, or have suffered massive violations of human rights. </li>
			</ul>
			<p>You must also be:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>outside Canada,</li>
				<li>referred by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (<abbr>UNHCR</abbr>) or another referral organization or be sponsored by a private sponsorship group, and </li>
				<li>privately sponsored, or have the funds needed to support yourself and any dependants after you arrive in Canada.</li>				
			</ul>
			<p>You will have to pass a medical exam and security and criminal checks.</p>
			<h4>Some people are not eligible</h4>
			<p>You are not eligible to resettle to Canada as a refugee from outside Canada if:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>you have another secure offer for protection, such as an offer to be resettled in another country;</li>
				<li>you become a citizen of another country and have the protection of that country;</li>
				<li>you choose to return to live in the country you had left; or</li>
				<li>the reasons for your fear of persecution no longer exist.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Want to live in  Quebec?</h4>
			<p>The Province of Quebec selects its own refugees. Find  out about <a href="http://www.immigration-quebec.gouv.qc.ca/en/immigrate-settle/refugees-other/refugee-selected/selection.html">Québec&rsquo;s procedures for selecting refugees abroad</a>. </p></details>
            <details><summary><strong>Sponsor a refugee</strong></summary><p>You can sponsor refugees from abroad who qualify to come to Canada. Sponsors must provide financial and emotional assistance for refugees once they arrive in Canada.</p>
            <p>Each year, millions of people are forced to flee their homelands to escape persecution, war or severe human rights abuses. Often these people can never return home.</p>

<p>The Private Sponsorship of Refugees Program helps thousands of refugees every year. You or your group can sponsor refugees from abroad who qualify to come to Canada. As a sponsor, you provide financial and emotional support for the refugees for the duration of the sponsorship. This includes help for housing, clothing and food. Most sponsorships last for one year, but some refugees may be eligible for assistance from their sponsors for up to three years.</p>

<p>Refugees must qualify for entry under Canada’s laws and must pass medical and security checks before they can come to Canada.</p>
<h3>Sponsorship Agreement Holders</h3>

<p>A number of groups across the country have signed agreements with the Government of Canada to help support refugees from abroad when they resettle in Canada. They are known as sponsorship agreement holders.</p>
<h3>Blended Visa Office-Referred Program</h3>

<p>The Blended Visa Office-Referred (VOR) Program matches refugees identified for resettlement by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) with private sponsors in Canada.</p>
<h3>Groups of five</h3>

<p>A group of five or more Canadian citizens or permanent residents over the age of 18 can sponsor one or more refugees to come to Canada and settle in their area.</p>
<h3>Community sponsors</h3>

<p>Some community groups can sponsor refugees to come to Canada.</p>
<h3>Joint Assistance Sponsorship Program</h3>

<p>Organizations can work as partners with Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC) to resettle refugees with special needs.</p>
<h3>Sponsors in Quebec</h3>

<p>Quebec has its own process to sponsor refugees. Find more about <a href="http://www.immigration-quebec.gouv.qc.ca/en/immigrate-settle/refugees-other/collective-sponsorship/index.html">refugee sponsorship in Quebec</a>.</p>

 <details><summary><strong>Claim refugee protection from inside Canada</strong></summary> 
 <p>On December 15, 2012, Canada&rsquo;s asylum system changed.  Under the new system, asylum claims will be heard faster. This means that those who need Canada&rsquo;s protection will get it faster, while those who do not, will be sent home faster. </p>

	  <p>Canada offers refugee protection  to some people in Canada who fear persecution or who would be in danger if they  had to leave. Some dangers they may face include the following: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>torture; </li>
        <li>a risk to their life; or </li>
        <li>a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or  punishment. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you feel you could face one of  these risks if you go back to your home country or the country where you  normally live, you may be able to seek protection in Canada as a refugee.      </p>
     <p>Canada offers refugee protection to people  in Canada who fear persecution and who are unwilling or unable to return to  their home country.</p>
			<h3> Eligibility</h3>
			<p>			  Some people are not eligible to  claim refugee protection in Canada. </p>
			<p> Officers receiving your refugee  claim will decide whether it is eligible for referral to the Immigration and  Refugee Board of Canada (<abbr>IRB</abbr>), an independent administrative tribunal that  makes decisions on immigration and refugee matters. The <abbr title="Immigration and  Refugee Board of Canada">IRB</abbr> decides who is a  Convention refugee or a person in need of protection. </p>
			<p> Your refugee claim may not be  eligible for referral to the <abbr title="Immigration and  Refugee Board of Canada">IRB</abbr> if:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>You have been recognized as a Convention refugee by  another country to which you can return; </li>
              <li>You have already been granted protected person  status in Canada; </li>
              <li>You arrived via the <a href="/english/department/laws-policy/menu-safethird.asp">Canada-United States border</a>; </li>
              <li>You are not admissible to Canada on security  grounds, or because of criminal activity or human rights violations; </li>
              <li>You made a previous refugee claim that was found to  be ineligible for referral to the <abbr title="Immigration and  Refugee Board of Canada">IRB</abbr>; </li>
              <li>You made a previous refugee claim that was rejected  by the <abbr title="Immigration and  Refugee Board of Canada">IRB</abbr>; or </li>
              <li>You abandoned or withdrew a previous refugee       claim. </li>
            </ul>
			<p>Please see the <a href="http://www.irb-cisr.gc.ca/Eng/RefClaDem/Pages/ClaDem.aspx"><abbr title="Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada">IRB</abbr> website</a> to find out more about making an asylum claim in Canada.  </p>
            <p>In addition, people who are  subject to a removal order cannot make a refugee claim.</p>
            <h3> Safe Third Country Agreement</h3>
            <p>              Canada has an agreement with the  United States where people who want to make a refugee claim must do so in the  first safe country they arrive in. This means that if you enter Canada at a  land border from the United States, you cannot make a refugee claim in Canada.  In some cases this <a href="/english/department/laws-policy/menu-safethird.asp">rule does not apply</a> (for example, if you have family  in Canada).</p>
            <h3> Definitions</h3>
            <p>              You may find the  following definitions useful as you learn more about refugee claims in Canada.</p>
            <p> <strong>Convention refugee</strong></p>
            <p>              Convention  refugees are people who are outside their home country or the country where  they normally live, and who are unwilling to return because of a well-founded  fear of persecution based on: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>race; </li>
              <li>religion; </li>
              <li>political opinion; </li>
              <li>nationality; or </li>
              <li>membership in a particular social group, such as women or people of a  particular sexual orientation. </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Person in need of protection</h3>
            <p>              A person in need of protection is a person in  Canada whose removal to their home country or country where they normally live would  subject them personally to: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>a danger of torture; </li>
              <li>a risk to their life; or </li>
              <li>a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or  punishment.</li>
            </ul>
